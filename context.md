# Weather Forecast App - Context

## Project Overview
This project involves building a Weather Forecast App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app retrieves weather data from the OpenWeather API and displays it to the user. The project is divided into three prototypes, each with increasing functionality and complexity.

## File Structure
- **prototype-1/**: Contains the initial version of the app with basic functionality.
  - **index.html**: Main HTML file for the app.
  - **styles.css**: CSS file for styling.
  - **script.js**: JavaScript file for functionality.
- **prototype-2/**: Adds more features and improves the user interface.
  - **index.html**: Main HTML file for the app.
  - **styles.css**: CSS file for styling.
  - **script.js**: JavaScript file for functionality.
  - **connection.php**: PHP script for database connection and API handling.
  - **database_export.sql**: MySQL database export.
  - **README.md**: Brief documentation for Prototype 2.
- **prototype-3/**: Finalizes the app with advanced features and optimizations.
  - **index.html**: Main HTML file for the final version of the app.
  - **styles.css**: CSS file for styling.
  - **script.js**: JavaScript file for functionality.
  - **connection.php**: PHP script for database connection and API handling.
  - **database_export.sql**: MySQL database export.
  - **README.md**: Documentation for Prototype 3.
- **final-version/**: The completed version of the app, ready for submission.
  - **index.html**: Main HTML file for the completed app.
  - **styles.css**: CSS file for styling.
  - **script.js**: JavaScript file for functionality.
  - **README.md**: Final documentation for the completed app.
- **assets/**: Contains shared resources like images and icons.
